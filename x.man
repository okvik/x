.TH X 1
.SH NAME
x \- tools for dealing with alien systems
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I X
is a collection of programs that tries to enable convenient
interaction with alien systems of the UNIXÂ® variety from the
extreme comfort of Plan 9.
.PP
These programs rely on the namespace convention whereupon the
root hierarchy of the remote system to be interacted with is
mounted, usually through
.IR sshfs (4),
at the
.IR mntgen (4)
provided mountpoint under
.I /x
named after the
.B user@host
login tuple used to mount the system.
.PP
In this way the working directory of a program is loaded with
two bits of information about the remote system: the login
that can be used to access it, and the path relative to the
remote root - which are exploited by the programs described
here to provide some further convenience.
.SH SETUP
.PP
Create the
.I /x
directory on your root file server and make sure to have the
.IR mntgen (4)
started somewhere convenient, perhaps in your profile:
.EX
; mount -c /srv/boot /n/boot
; mkdir /x
; mntgen /x
